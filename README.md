# Analyzing Food Safety Compliance in Toronto: Identifying Current Hazards and Challenges
## Overview

This Repo conducts an in-depth investigation into the current state of food safety compliance in Toronto, pinpointing the present condition of food safety in the city. By utilizing a dataset that includes various dining establishments and their inspection results, the study employs statistical methods for analysis and visualization, including the development of logistic regression models. The goal is to highlight areas requiring immediate attention or policy adjustments through a detailed examination of inspection reports, types of violations, frequencies, dates, and the nature of the violations. The findings suggest that the government needs to increase inspection frequency based on factors such as different seasons, types of food businesses, and the nature of violations to enhance local food safety, which is crucial for the health of every resident in Toronto.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, clean, and model data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Chat GPT3.5 was used in parts of coding and writing. For coding, it was used in parts of `02-data_cleaning` and `04-model`. For writing, parts of the result and model section were written with the usage of LLM. The specific conversations of the usage of LLM can be seen in `other/llm`.
