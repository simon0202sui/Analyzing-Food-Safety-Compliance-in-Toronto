I need to do data cleansing, what do you suggest

ChatGPT
It is very important to perform data cleaning before performing data analysis, as this can help improve the accuracy and reliability of your model. Here are some basic data cleaning steps that you can apply to your dataset:

Deal with missing values:
Determine the number and distribution of missing values in the data.
Depending on the nature of the data and the purpose of the analysis, decide whether to remove rows containing missing values or fill in the missing values. For example, for numeric features, you can populate with the mean or median; for categorical features, you can populate with the plurality.
Check the data type:
Make sure that each column is of the correct data type. For example, dates should be in date format and values should be of numeric type.
Remove duplicate data:
Check for duplicate rows in the data and remove them as needed.
Handle outliers:
Identify and handle outliers. Statistical methods (e.g. IQR, z-score) can be used to identify outliers and decide whether to remove or replace the values.
Standardize data formats:
Ensure that all data follows a uniform format, such as converting all text data to uniform case, or standardizing date formats.
Create new features/remove unnecessary columns:
Depending on the needs of the analysis, it may be necessary to derive new features from existing data or remove columns that are not important to the analysis.

Based on the cleaned dataset, use rcode to generate a table for sum data.

ChatGPT
Sure, you can use R to generate summary tables of your cleaned data to explore relationships or distributions within it. Let's create a summary table that categorizes the data by Establishment Type and Establishment Status, and includes counts and mean values of Min. Inspections Per Year. This will provide a quick overview of how inspection frequency might vary by establishment type and status.

Here's how you can do it using R:
R
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Assuming the cleaned data is already loaded into 'data'
# If not, you can load it using:
# data <- read.csv("path_to_your_cleaned_file.csv")

# Creating a summary table
summary_table <- data %>%
  group_by(Establishment.Type, Establishment.Status) %>%
  summarise(
    Count = n(),  # Number of records per group
    Average.Inspections = mean(Min.Inspections.Per.Year, na.rm = TRUE)  # Mean of inspections per year, ignoring NA values
  ) %>%
  ungroup()  # Remove grouping for further operations

# Printing the summary table
print(summary_table)

# Optionally, saving the table to a CSV file
write.csv(summary_table, "summary_table.csv", row.names = FALSE)
